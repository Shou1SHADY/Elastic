## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark grayish blue (#303A4B) to establish a professional and trustworthy aesthetic reminiscent of industrial environments, but without being somber. Chosen to align with terminal-industries.comâ€™s premium and B2B-focused atmosphere.
- Background color: Very dark grayish blue (#1A202C) which is of the same hue as the primary color, to ensure a harmonious base for the design, reinforcing the futuristic yet professional aesthetic.
- Accent color: Electric cyan (#7DF9FF) to draw attention to key interactive elements and provide a technologically advanced, cutting-edge feel that highlights innovation without overwhelming the overall dark interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) is recommended. 'Inter' gives a modern, machined, objective, neutral look suitable for a B2B application.
- Minimal, custom icons representing different aspects of the manufacturing process and company values. Use a thin line style to maintain a clean, modern look.
- Full-screen layout with distinct sections delineated by smooth scrolling transitions. Hero section occupies the full viewport initially.
- Smooth, subtle animations on scroll and hover events. Parallax effects to create depth. High-performance animations that avoid janky movement, critical for portraying professionalism.
